Summary
-------

Roomies is a shared calendar web app that makes scheduling events between housemates simple and convenient. The app ensures that certain events only appear on the calendar once agreed upon by all housemates. Users can opt to receive notifications via text message and approve or deny events with one letter responses or simply respond to event requests in the browser. The app helps users avoid scheduling noisy events at the same time as quiet hours and allows users to reserve time slots in shared bathrooms. Roomies also protects user's calendars from being seen by strangers. Any user seeking access to a calendar must first be invited by an existing user of that calendar.
